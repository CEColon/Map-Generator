# Map-Generator
A Map Generator I made in high school, and something I'm still working on for a game project (still in development)

This project went through multiple iterations:

The first iteration was inspired from a game I used to play called Realm of the Mad God, but I had the idea of making multiple islands instead of one giant island. Of course, it didn't use the same method, but I used steadily decreasing elevation to generate the maps, and basically smeared the current height in all directions. Granted it's a weird way to generate a map. The program is a mix of a console application with a graphics window. If you want to generate a map with this method, run the OldMain program, type C to create a map, and then O to use the old method. The program also comes with the functionality to move around with the arrow keys, swap between map overlays using the E key for elevation heat map, R for regular map, and B for biome map (note that the biome overlay on the regular map is disabled for testing purposes). Additionally, there is also functionality to save and load maps as JSON files. Pressing the S key will save the newly generated map as a JSON file, and running the program alongside typing L instead will load a map given a filename.

The second iteration was made when I started developing the game idea I had in 2024 (still in planning phases). The first idea for the overworld map was to have roads that move around and spread outward from a singular division point, with the spawn location coming from the south and generally moving upward toward the division point. I then used the same elevation properties as I did with the old iteration of the map generator. However, this wasn't successful, as road intersections aren't handled, and was not a good execution of the idea. If you would like to run this version, run the OldMain method, type C to create a map, and then N to use this method.

The third iteration is currently still in development, but relies on the use of hexagons attached to each other. In this case, the plan was to generate one hexagon, and use a random line segment from the previous hexagon to generate the rest. There are still cases in which the program generates wrong hexagons which is the reason why it isn't finished yet. The plan is to get to the point where there are no incorrect hexagons 100% of the time and use the vertices of the generated hexagons to normalize the map. Currently, the Main function is working with Dungeon Creation at the moment, and is my current debug suite. If you'd like to see how a hexagon is created, then uncomment the testHexes function and run the program.
